    /// A DependencyGraph can be modeled as a set of dependencies, where a dependency is an ordered 
    /// pair of strings.  Two dependencies (s1,t1) and (s2,t2) are considered equal if and only if 
    /// s1 equals s2 and t1 equals t2.  (Recall that sets never contain duplicates.  If an attempt
    /// is made to add an element to a set, and the element is already in the set, the set remains unchanged.)
    /// 
    /// Given a DependencyGraph DG:
    /// 
    ///    (1) If s is a string, the set of all strings t such that the dependency (s,t) is in DG 
    ///    is called the dependents of s, which we will denote as dependents(s).
    ///        
    ///    (2) If s is a string, the set of all strings t such that the dependency (t,s) is in DG 
    ///    is called the dependees of s, which we will denote as dependees(s).
    ///    
    /// The notations dependents(s) and dependees(s) are used in the specification of the methods of the class.
    ///
    /// For example, suppose DG = {("a", "b"), ("a", "c"), ("b", "d"), ("d", "d")}
    ///     dependents("a") = {"b", "c"}
    ///     dependents("b") = {"d"}
